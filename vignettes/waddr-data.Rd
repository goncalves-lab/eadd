This package provides supplementary data and and an example single cell RNA
sequencing dataset for the package `·∫ÅaddR`.

More specifically, the two datasets are:

* An empirical Brownian bridge distribution used as a reference to compute
p-values the asymptotic two-sample test in `waddR`.

* An example dataset of decidua and blood cells from a recent scRNAseq study
by Vento-Tormo et al. 2018 (data available
